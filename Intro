ELK is a simple but robust log analysis and an open source platform.
Splunk's enterprise software has been the market leader, but it is expensive for small to medium size companies.
################## Introduction to ELK Stack #######
Logstash -> Collect, parse and store data (it's a data pipeline ...and ingest data into Elastic search , file system or kafka queue)...pumps the data into any
destination 
Elastic Search -> ES is a core serach engine which is a data store for ELK Stack...you can search and analyze on the top of the stored data.
Kibana --> UI component , Graphing and Charting purpose
Why SwitchOver to ELK ?? .. Every Application and device generates logs in its own way [different formats]
NO CONSISTENCY ...DIFFERENT TIME FORMATS IN APPLICATIONS.. 
DECENTRALIZATION .. Logs are spread across different servers, located in different locations.
Different servers can have different kinds of logs.
How is it possible to develop a flexible and user-friendly real-time search engine for 30 million users ??
Elasticsearch to intelligently search and deliver content to millions of users.
Every log line is an event in logstash .. Manages Events and Logs >> Collects Data >> Parses Data >> Stores Data >> Enriches Data
